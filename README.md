# Dummy.js

*A simple, no-nonsense library for injecting dummy text in html pages.*

*****

## Introduction

It is extremely easy to start using Dummy.js. It is as easy as adding a script tag at the end of your body and adding an attribute to the elements you want dummy text in. I found it very cumbersome working with dummy text while designing web pages. In order to fix this issue for myself and all those facing it, I wrote this library.

## Website

[Dummy.js Official website](https://shreyasminocha.me/Dummy.js)

## Getting Started

```html
  <body>

    <!-- The /s plural is just for the semantics. You are well-off with 5,sentence -->

    <h1 data-dummy-fill="5,word(/s)"></h1>
    <p data-dummy-fill="6,sentence"></p>
    <p data-dummy-fill="1,paragraph"></p>
    ...
    <script src="/path/to/dummy.min.js"></script>

  </body>
```

There! Dummy.js is at your service.
Here's a [working demo](https://shreyasminocha.me/Dummy.js/demo.html).

## CDN

We have an official CDN URL! You can now use Dummy.js without downloading it to your server. Here's the link: [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/dummyjs/latest/dummy.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/dummyjs/latest/dummy.min.js).

## Disable

If you would like to disable Dummy.js, this can be done without removing it from your web page.

```html
<script src="/path/to/Dummy.js" data-dummy="disable"></script>
```
