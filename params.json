  "body": "# Dummy.js\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nDummy.js is a simple, no-nonsense library for injecting dummy text in html pages. It is extremely easy to start using Dummy.js. It is as easy as adding a script tag at the end of your body and adding an attribute to the elements you want dummy text in. I found it very cumbersome working with dummy text while designing web pages. In order to fix this issue for myself and all those facing it, I wrote this library.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nDownload the code from [github](https://github.com/shreyasminocha/Dummy.js) and use it like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n  <body>\r\n\r\n    <!-- The /s plural is just for the semantics. You are well-off with 5,sentence -->\r\n\r\n    <h1 data-dummy-fill=\"5,word(/s)\"></h1>\r\n    <p data-dummy-fill=\"6,sentence\"></p>\r\n    <p data-dummy-fill=\"1,paragraph\"></p>\r\n    ...\r\n    <script src=\"/path/to/dummy.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n  </body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere! Dummy.js is at your service.\r\nHere's a [working demo(broken at the moment)](https://github.com/shreyasminocha/Dummy.js#).\r\n\r\n## CDN\r\n\r\nThis section will be updated once Dummy.js has an official CDN.\r\n\r\n## Disable\r\n\r\nIf you would like to disable Dummy.js, this can be done without removing it from your web page.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"/path/to/Dummy.js\" data-dummy=\"disable\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upcoming\r\nIn the upcoming versions, we're planning to add a configuration flow. For example, the you'd be able\r\nto configure the number of words in a sentence in a paragraph; unlike what's the case right now.\r\n\r\n## Code\r\n\r\nYou can find the code for this library on [github](https://github.com/shreyasminocha/Dummy.js). You are more than welcome to fork the source code and contribute to the library. Thanks!\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nI would like to thank all those who have taken the time to contribute to this library by fixing bugs, contributing code, or spreading the word.",
